  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCshu">Nushu</a> (<span lang="zh-Nshu">𛆁𛈬</span>, <span lang="zh-CN">女书</span>) is a mysterious script used exclusively among women in Jiangyong County of Southern China. It is handed down by mother to daughter among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese">Han</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_people">Yao</a> people from generation to generation in Jiangyong County and its adjacent areas, becoming a unique cultural phenomenon in human history.</p>

  <p>Nushu characters are rhomboidal in shape, slim in style and imaginative in the form. The total amount of the characters being discovered is up to two thousand, all of which contain solely four kinds of strokes – dotted, vertical, oblique and arcuate.</p>
  <p>Although Nushu is derived from Chinese characters, there is no absolute correspondence between them. Unlike Chinese Characters, Nushu is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary">syllabic script</a>, for every character of it represents either a syllable or a group of syllables that are similar in pronunciation. Meanwhile, the characters accommodate to be curved in shape, because they are also embroidered on clothes and flower belts besides being written down.</p>

  <p>The earliest record of Nushu script is the Diaomu coin (<span lang="zh-CN">雕母钱</span>) issued by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom">Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</a> during the Xianfeng Period in Qing Dynasty. The Nushu characters “women all over the world are sisters in one family” were carved on the backside of the coin.</p>

  <p>Nushu is used to record the local dialect. It could be written on cotton books as wedding gifts, which are called “third day missives” (<span lang="zh-CN">三朝书</span>), or written on fans, handkerchiefs and papers. It is also embroidered on handkerchiefs. Women in the local areas used to do the needlework together, reading, singing and teaching Nushu. Such activity forms a special Nushu culture.</p>

  <p>In 1982, Professor Gong Zhebing (<span lang="zh-CN">宫哲兵</span>) from Wuhan University discovered Nushu in Jiangyong County, Hunan Province. The discovery caused a sensation throughout the world. Experts and scholars at home and abroad leave for Jiangyong to do investigation, learning and discovery. In recent years, projects for rescuing and protecting the Nushu culture are being actively carried out in Yongzhou City. People carry forward and promote the culture by building Nushu villages and Nushu museums, making Nushu craftsmanship and developing Nushu culture industry. <a href="https://unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3340.pdf"><em>Proposal for encoding Nüshu in the SMP of the UCS</em></a>, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=S1ZmGQAACAAJ"><em>Comparison of the characters used to write Nüshu</em></a> (女书用字比较) and several other documents are made by a group of student from Tsinghua University. They are also the representatives to submit the encoding proposal.</p>

  <p>The Online Nushu Dictionary is an open-source project maintained by the Nushu Developers Workgroup, containing the Nushu converter, Nushu list and Nushu IME. It is a comprehensive website for the Nushu script.</p>
